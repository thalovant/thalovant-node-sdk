Last Edit: Claude Opus 5.5 - 2026-11-03 - Motive: Chat apps (0.10.0), merged with the usualForm parity follow-up entry from main.

# Maintenance report

## 2026-11-03: chat apps (0.10.0)

**Change.** Added the owner routes under `/v1/bridges` to `ThalovantControlPlane` (`src/control.ts`), their models, readers, request bodies and `SecretValue` (`src/chat-apps.ts`), the exports (`src/index.ts`), and `ThalovantApiError.fields` (`src/errors.ts`). Version 0.10.0 in `package.json`, `package-lock.json` and `src/version.ts`. README "Chat apps" section, CHANGELOG entry, and a `chat-apps` entry in `contracts/sdk-parity.json` with refreshed hashes for the capabilities whose evidence files changed.

**Rationale.** Hub owners can connect chat networks to their hubs; the SDKs and the MCP server expose the same owner routes with parallel names. The Python SDK is the parity reference.

**Verification.**
- `npm ci`, `npm audit --audit-level=high` (0 vulnerabilities), `npm test` (748 tests: 747 passed, 1 skipped live-interop test that needs credentials), `npm pack --dry-run` (116 files), on Node.js 22 locally; CI runs Node.js 20, 22 and 24.
- `test/chat-apps.test.ts`: 31 tests covering every route, parsing with unknown enumeration values and absent optional members, errors with `code` and `fields`, the plan and auth error classes, and secrets absent from every printed form.
- The shared api-error vectors still pass; one local assertion now expects `fields: []` in the error's JSON, and a new one checks that an explicit `fields` wins over the problem's.
- CodeRabbit review: a status without `source` now reads as `unavailable` instead of being refused; `listBridges()` documents that it returns one bounded answer; the explicit-`fields` tests (a list and an empty list) and an empty-`source` test were added. Declined, with reasons in the review threads: making `fields` non-enumerable, and scrubbing echoed secrets shorter than 8 characters.
- Parity checker run as a consumer: verified, with the expected rollout note that the reference does not know `chat-apps` yet.

### Transparency report

- **AI model:** Claude Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`).
- **Actions taken:** wrote the chat apps module, the control-plane methods, the error `fields` member, the tests, README, CHANGELOG, parity entry and these repository notes; ran the test suite, package check and parity checker.
- **Oversight:** automated tests and CI, CodeRabbit review on the pull request, merged by the repository owner's delegated agent.

## 2026-11-03 — CodeRabbit follow-ups (#80, #84, #86)

Four review threads were still open on merged pull requests. Each was checked against `main` (a09a32a) before acting.

| Thread | Finding | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| #84 `src/language-matching.ts` | Document the byte comparison in `usualForm()` and put its source and test under the listing parity capability | Fixed: `contracts/sdk-parity.json` `listing` declares `src/language-matching.ts`, `src/language-matching-data.ts` and `test/usual-form.test.ts`; CHANGELOG entry |
| #80 `package.json` | Make `record-conformance` portable | Already fixed in the #80 squash (1423a0c): `scripts/record-conformance.mjs` sets the variable through `env` and cleans up in `finally` |
| #86 `src/control.ts` (device-token poll) | Redact the device code on the non-pending error branch | Already fixed in #89 (59d57bb); covered by `test/home-link.test.ts` "a refused device-token poll never repeats the device code" |
| #86 `src/control.ts` (`apiError`) | Redact JSON-escaped secrets before parsing | Already fixed in #89 (59d57bb): `redactSecretsInText` + `jsonSpellings` in `src/redact.ts`; covered by `test/home-link.test.ts` "a secret the SDK sent is redacted in its JSON-escaped spellings too" |

### Verification

- `npm ci && npm test`: 717 tests, 716 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed.
- The reference's `scripts/check-sdk-parity.py --consumer thalovant-node-sdk` passes with the new contract.
- Gate evidence: with the new contract, a one-line edit to `src/language-matching.ts` fails the check (`listing: implementation changed: src/language-matching.ts`); with the old contract the same edit passes. That is the gap the thread named.

## Transparency Report

- **AI Model**: Claude Opus 5.5.
- **Actions Taken**: Read the four threads and the current code and tests; added three files to the `listing` capability with their SHA-256 evidence; wrote the CHANGELOG entry, this report and `AUDIT.md`; replied on the threads.
- **Oversight**: Run by an agent on the repository owner's request to handle every open CodeRabbit thread; merged through the normal CI gates. No package file changes, so `auto-release.yml` cuts no release.
